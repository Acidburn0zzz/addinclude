.SH NAME
addinclude \- adds an include to a C header- or source file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B addinclude
filename include
.SH DESCRIPTION
Addinclude provides a simple way to add includes to C header files or C source files.
.sp
Sometimes, a patch is overkill and search and replace does not cut it.
.sp
Addinclude adds the includes after the first #ifdef and preferrably together with the other #include lines.
.sp
If the header is empty, or there are no #ifdefs or #includes, the include is inserted at the top of the file.
